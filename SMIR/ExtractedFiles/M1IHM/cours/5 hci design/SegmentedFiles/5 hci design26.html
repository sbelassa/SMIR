<p>Advises for interface design
</p>
<p>I start with a black and white concept
I only use colors when the interface ergonomy is improved
I use colors to organize and show relationships
I use colors to improved the search task (within la ist)
I use colors to focus attention
I promote a redundant design (color/symbol)
I do not use colors without a corresponding specific meaning
