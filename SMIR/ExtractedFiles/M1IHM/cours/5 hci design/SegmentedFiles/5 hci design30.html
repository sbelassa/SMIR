<p>Ergonomy tests
</p>
<p>The tests are conducted using a direct designation (keyboard,
mouse, trackball) and feedback (the button is shown pressed)
</p>
<p>Results
I If latency is greater than 200ms
</p>
<p>error rate increase
perturbed use
inefficiency feeling
</p>
<p>I If latency is greater than 8 sec, serious questions about
stability
</p>
<p>I perceived latency depends on the perceived complexity of the
task
</p>
<p>Which consequences on HCI ?
I a small latency for the interaction is crucial
I inform the user about the state (frozen) of the app
