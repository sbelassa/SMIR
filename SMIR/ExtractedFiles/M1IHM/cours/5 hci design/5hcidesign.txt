Choosing the information to be shown

Only the data needed to the decision task
I usually too many technical data
I the mental load of the user must be taken into account
I the designer has to know the importance of each data in the

decision process

Avoid too many data on the screen
I depends on the user class and the type of software
I helping pop-ups can be used

Choosing the information : more

All the data needed for the decision process
I each screen must be :

self-sufficient
dedicated to an idea or a specific task

Avoid back and forth between screens
I the fullfillment of a task must be done without the help of

another screen
I usually, a change of screen is mentaly associated with a the

fullfillment of a task (closure Gestalt)
I the human short-term memory is emptied after a change of

screen
I avoid the need for the user to memorize the previous screen

Choosing the information : more

Error messages
I must be complete (provide all necessary data)
I easily understood(not too technical )

IO Error 22
I do not need a manual

Error W1409
I help the user to fix the error

file name too long
-> file name must not exceed 8 characters

Arrangement / design of controls

the upper-left corner of the screen is read first
I searching for important data in a diagonal reading process

(western writing culture specific)

Entity logical grouping
I reasonable number of entities per group and reasonable size

of entity
I reasonable number of groups

Symetry and balance are important
I use space filling between groups
I use centering

Devising an Interface standard for all the
screen

A common design for the screens
I fonts
I buttons
I borders
I colors
I menu positioning/ status messages/ errors messages

Be faithful to your standard
I usually, a generic screen is devised.
I then, the specific screens are derived from the generic screen

Fonts and styles

Limit yourself to a single font or two
I a font must be associated with a meaning (e.g. Courrier for

filenames, Helvetica for button name)
I avoid funny fonts (no "comic sans ms", never...)
I avoid serif fonts (to many details which make the reading

uneasy), prefer "sans serif fonts" (Helvetica, Arial...)

Avoid change of font style
I avoid switch between black, italic, underscore,
I avoid switch in caractere

Avoid capitals
I associated with scream
I uneasy to read
I restricted to titles and groups
I Smallcaps can be used instead

Text display

What kind of use
I icon description, command description, function description
I system messages, status messages
I instructions

drives the user
is sometimes interactive
usually, related to the manual

Rules

Buttons

Large enough buttons
I reduce the duration to perform the action (Fitts law)

Keep a same size across the interface
I various button sizes are associated with various meaning and

thus generate questions
I the variation is allowed for specific use : buttons rows,

important frequency of use

Buttons grouping
I by function similarity
I by modal dialog box ( that forces the user to answer before

anything else)

HCI design, Human Computer Interface 15/37

buttons : more

I Use a Capital as first character of the word
I Use small non ambiguous terms
I The chosen location for important buttons (OK, cancel) is

crucial
I those places must remain the same on all screen
I invalidate inactive buttons (grey label, grey button)

Menus

I organized according to corresponding tasks
I stay coherent with the terminology of the software (and the

manual)
I use dots at the end of the word to inform the user of the

necessary to add information in the following actions (save
as...)

I invalidate inactive menus (grey words, grey label)
I do not hesitate to use check boxes and radio boxes in the

menus
I no more than two levels of imbrication in the menu or else :

too complicated
hide some choices
hard to manipulate

I use (and inform the user about) shortcuts

Part III : colors
Use of colors in order to:

I focus attention ( e.g. on a warning )
I differentiate parts (e.g an element of a group, a particular

status)
I group together (e.g. similar properties or functionalities)

Faster location and understanding
image needed

Color Ergonomy

Number of colors per screen (Post, 1997)
I depends on the kind of colors and of the associated tasks
I the use of too many colors implies a harder perception. The

important entities are no more highlighted
I reduce the use of various colors (depending on the kind of

software)

how many colors ?
I text editor : 3 colors (Van Nes, 1986)
I identification by color : no more than 6 colors (AFNOR,

1997)
I use an explanation screen if more than 6 colors
I use colors which are distant in the visual spectrum
I beware of blue (the fovea is less sensible to blue)

Color Ergonomy

what about images
I color images must be placed on a grey background

(black,grey or white)
I grey images on colored background

in order to provide :
I better contrast
I better entity detection

Color Ergonomy

Distance and view angle influence perception (norme
ISO 9241) :

I avoid red and green if view angle is > 40 degrees
I avoid yellow if > 40 degrees
I avoid blue if > 60 degrees
I avoid saturated colors and high muminance for a distance >

60 cm
I avoid saturated colors on dark background for a distance >

60 cm

Color ergonomy

Allow color parameterization
I to prevent problem related to bad color perception

("colorblind" )
I to follow user habits
I to adapt with working environment (lighting conditions)

Inconvenients related to full parameterization
I time consuming
I ergonomy issues

Alternative : allow a choice within a verified subset of
colors

I together with an expert mode
I time consuming

Advises for interface design

I start with a black and white concept
I only use colors when the interface ergonomy is improved
I use colors to organize and show relationships
I use colors to improved the search task (within la ist)
I use colors to focus attention
I promote a redundant design (color/symbol)
I do not use colors without a corresponding specific meaning

Time is important

I soft architecture, algorithms, data structures influence latency
I sometimes, the latency is part of the application life cycle

(optim/real time)
I waiting generates stress

Real time and perceived time [Bickford, Apple]
I measured time (universal time)
I user perceived time : no framework, depends on the cognitive

load

Illustration : copy of a bunch of files

option 1 : frozen interface (no information on the
progression)

I less measured time
I greater perceived time
I no cognitive task, waiting attitude (with no information on

the duration)

option 2 : progress bar
I slower task (HCI dialog with the system, progress bar upgrade
I smaller perceived duration (associated with a flexibility/speed

notions)
I cognitive task : controlling the progress, other tasks

Ergonomy tests

The tests are conducted using a direct designation (keyboard,
mouse, trackball) and feedback (the button is shown pressed)

Results
I If latency is greater than 200ms

error rate increase
perturbed use
inefficiency feeling

I If latency is greater than 8 sec, serious questions about
stability

I perceived latency depends on the perceived complexity of the
task

Which consequences on HCI ?
I a small latency for the interaction is crucial
I inform the user about the state (frozen) of the app

Sandglass as cursor

I inform the user about the still running status
I no information about the duration
I suitable to short duration (1 to 10 secondes)
I no abort status

Implementation

Progress Bar

Progress bar
I allows an estimation of the waiting duration (and to self

organize accordingly)
I is suitable for duration > 10s

Always allow the user to interrupt the task
I because the task has been chosen by mistake
I because the progress bar indicates that the duration will be

too large

Consequences of a task interruption
I the app must return in the previous state
I this could be very difficult in some case (network, etc...)

Progress Bar : implementation

The critical problem of the progress bar upgrade

the event loop must be continuously executed in order to refresh
the windows

I or else the task must be cut into micro sub-tasks, and the
interface is upgraded after each sub-task(paint/update)

I problem : some tasks are not cuttable
I modularity principle is broken

or parallelization
I by fork/thread concept
I communication between processus

critical sections of codes must be known
synchronization mechanisms

Stop or Abort of a task

taking into account from the beginning of the problems
related to IHM

I foreseen the undo process, getting back to a stable state or in
the previous state

I some tasks are not stoppable : the user must be warn
